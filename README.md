life_the_universe_and_everything
================================

This code repository is a mammoth, ambitious attempt to codify every object and process in the universe. It has been a great disappointment to me that my personal projects are always of too great a scope to complete on my own. If I am destined to die having never truly completed anything, at the very least I will make that uncompleted anything a very big uncompleted anything.  It is a lesson in hyperbole.  

Contributors are very welcome.
